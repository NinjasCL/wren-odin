# Wren API Bindings

Wren is a small, fast, class-based concurrent scripting language

Think Smalltalk in a Lua-sized package with a dash of Erlang and wrapped up in
a familiar, modern syntax.

```js
System.print("Hello, world!")

class Wren {
  flyTo(city) {
    System.print("Flying to %(city)")
  }
}

var adjectives = Fiber.new {
  ["small", "clean", "fast"].each {|word| Fiber.yield(word) }
}

while (!adjectives.isDone) System.print(adjectives.call())
```

## Usage

See more complete examples at `example.odin` and `tests/wren_tests.odin`

```go
package main

import "core:fmt"

import wren "../vendor/wren/0.4"

main :: proc() {
    config := wren.Configuration{}
    wren.InitConfiguration(&config)

    vm := wren.NewVM(&config)

    module : cstring = "main"
    script : cstring = `System.print("Hello Wren from Odin!")`
    result := wren.Interpret(vm, module, script)

    switch result {
        case .WREN_RESULT_COMPILE_ERROR:
            fmt.println("Compile error")
        case .WREN_RESULT_RUNTIME_ERROR:
            fmt.println("Runtime error")
        case .WREN_RESULT_SUCCESS:
            fmt.println("Success!")
    }
}

/**
The result of a loadModuleFn call.

`wrenSetSlotNewForeign()` exactly once.

	- `finalize`: `FinalizerFn`: The callback invoked when the garbage collector is about to collect a foreign object's memory.
This may be `NULL` if the foreign class does not need to finalize.

*/
ForeignClassMethodsStruct :: struct {
	allocate : ForeignMethodFn,
	finalize : FinalizerFn,
}

/**
The Configuration structure to hold the data passed to the VM initialization.

- Description:
	- `reallocateFn`: `ReallocateFn`: The callback Wren will use to allocate, reallocate, and deallocate memory.
  If `NULL`, defaults to a built-in function that uses `realloc` and `free`.

	- `resolveModuleFn` : `ResolveModuleFn`: The callback Wren uses to resolve a module name.
	Some host applications may wish to support "relative" imports, where the
  meaning of an import string depends on the module that contains it. To
  support that without baking any policy into Wren itself, the VM gives the
  host a chance to resolve an import string.
	Before an import is loaded, it calls this, passing in the name of the
  module that contains the import and the import string. The host app can
  look at both of those and produce a new "canonical" string that uniquely
  identifies the module. This string is then used as the name of the module
  going forward. It is what is passed to [loadModuleFn], how duplicate
  imports of the same module are detected, and how the module is reported in
  stack traces.
	If you leave this function NULL, then the original import string is
  treated as the resolved string.
	If an import cannot be resolved by the embedder, it should return NULL and
  Wren will report that as a runtime error.
	Wren will take ownership of the string you return and free it for you, so
  it should be allocated using the same allocation function you provide
  above.

	- `loadModuleFn` : `LoadModuleFn`: The callback Wren uses to load a module.
	Since Wren does not talk directly to the file system, it relies on the
  embedder to physically locate and read the source code for a module. The
  first time an import appears, Wren will call this and pass in the name of
  the module being imported. The method will return a result, which contains
  the source code for that module. Memory for the source is owned by the
  host application, and can be freed using the onComplete callback.
	This will only be called once for any given module name. Wren caches the
  result internally so subsequent imports of the same module will use the
  previous source and not call this.
	If a module with the given name could not be found by the embedder, it
  should return NULL and Wren will report that as a runtime error.

	- `bindForeignMethodFn` : `BindForeignMethodFn`: The callback Wren uses to find a foreign method and bind it to a class.
	When a foreign method is declared in a class, this will be called with the
	foreign method's module, class, and signature when the class body is
	executed. It should return a pointer to the foreign function that will be
	bound to that method.
	If the foreign function could not be found, this should return NULL and
	Wren will report it as runtime error.

	- `bindForeignClassFn` : `BindForeignClassFn`: The callback Wren uses to find a foreign class and get its foreign methods.
	When a foreign class is declared, this will be called with the class's
	module and name when the class body is executed. It should return the
  foreign functions uses to allocate and (optionally) finalize the bytes
  stored in the foreign object when an instance is created.

	- `writeFn` : `WriteFn`: The callback Wren uses to display text when `System.print()` or the other
	related functions are called. If this is `NULL`, Wren discards any printed text.

	- `errorFn` : `ErrorFn`: The callback Wren uses to report errors.
	When an error occurs, this will be called with the module name, line
	number, and an error message. If this is `NULL`, Wren doesn't report any
  errors.

	- `initialHeapSize` : `_c.size_t`: The number of bytes Wren will allocate before triggering the first garbage
	collection. If zero, defaults to 10MB.

	- `minHeapSize` : `_c.size_t`: After a collection occurs, the threshold for the next collection is
	determined based on the number of bytes remaining in use. This allows Wren
  to shrink its memory usage automatically after reclaiming a large amount
  of memory.
	This can be used to ensure that the heap does not get too small, which can
  in turn lead to a large number of collections afterwards as the heap grows
  back to a usable size.
	If zero, defaults to 1MB.

	- `heapGrowthPercent` : `_c.int`: Wren will resize the heap automatically as the number of bytes
  remaining in use after a collection changes. This number determines the
  amount of additional memory Wren will use after a collection, as a
  percentage of the current heap size.
  For example, say that this is 50. After a garbage collection, when there
  are 400 bytes of memory still in use, the next collection will be triggered
  after a total of 600 bytes are allocated (including the 400 already in
  use.)
  Setting this to a smaller number wastes less memory, but triggers more
  frequent garbage collections.
  If zero, defaults to 50.

	- `userData` : `rawptr`: User-defined data associated with the VM.

  [newSize] is the desired size. It should return [memory] if it was able to

		The following functions are intended to be called from foreign methods or

		register machine: you are given a numbered array of slots that values can be
		read from and written to. Values always live in a slot (unless explicitly
		captured using wrenGetSlotHandle(), which ensures the garbage collector can
		find them.

		When your foreign function is called, you are given one slot for the receiver
		and each argument to the method. The receiver is in slot 0 and the arguments
		are in increasingly numbered slots after that. You are free to read and
		write to those slots as you want. If you want more slots to use as scratch
		space, you can call wrenEnsureSlots() to add more.

		When your function returns, every slot except slot zero is discarded and the
		value in slot zero is used as the return value of the method. If you don't
		store a return value in that slot yourself, it will retain its previous
		value, the receiver.

		While Wren is dynamically typed, C is not. This means the C interface has to
		support the various types of primitive values a Wren variable can hold: bool,
		double, string, etc. If we supported this for every operation in the C API,
		there would be a combinatorial explosion of functions, like "get a
		double-valued element from a list", "insert a string key and double value
		into a map", etc.

		To avoid that, the only way to convert to and from a raw C value is by going
		into and out of a slot. All other functions work with values already in a
		slot. So, to add an element to a list, you put the list in one slot, and the
		element in another. Then there is a single API function wrenInsertInList()
		that takes the element out of that slot and puts it into the list.

		The goal of this API is to be easy to use while not compromising performance.
		The latter means it does not do type or bounds checking at runtime except
		using assertions which are generally removed from release builds. C is an
		unsafe language, so it's up to you to be careful to use it correctly. In
		return, you get a very fast FFI.
